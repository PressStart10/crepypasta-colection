so, I was stating a world, I looked around and something caut my eye. There it was, a sign that said "how nice is it to see you, say, are you alone", i was in my recording room, and had people in the house, so i replied no.
  "it's time for dinner!" said my mom
  "be right there" I replied
  this was odd.. to say the least, we just got a bell that SHE'D used, and  now she calles. Yet i go dowstaires anyway, i come back to see the sign saing "well, see you tomorow". and I ignored it.
